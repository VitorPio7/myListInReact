## About The Project

This is a foundational portfolio project designed to showcase a solid understanding of React's core principles without the overhead of complex state management libraries or back-end frameworks. It's a perfect example of how to build a functional, interactive front-end application from the ground up.

The user can add new tasks to a list, view all current tasks, and remove them once completed.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Add Tasks:** Quickly add new items to your to-do list via an input form.
-   **View Tasks:** All current tasks are displayed in a clean, organized list.
-   **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks individually with a single click.
-   **Local State Management:** The entire application state is managed locally within React components.

## üéØ Core React Concepts Illustrated

This project is an excellent demonstration of the following core React skills:

-   **State Management with `useState`:** The application's logic relies entirely on the `useState` hook to manage both the array of to-do items and the state of the input field.
-   **Component Props:** Data and functions (like the delete function) are passed from parent (`App`) to child (`TodoItem`) components, showcasing a clear understanding of component communication.
-   **List Rendering with `.map()`:** Dynamically renders the list of to-do items, assigning a unique `key` to each element for efficient updates.
-   **Event Handling:** Manages user interactions like form submissions (`onSubmit`) and button clicks (`onClick`) to trigger state updates.
-   **Component-Based Architecture:** The application is structured into logical, reusable components for maintainability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project was built with a minimal and focused tech stack:

-   **[React](https://reactjs.org/):** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/):** A modern front-end build tool for a fast development experience.
-   **[JavaScript (ES6+)](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/):** For all application logic.
-   **[CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html):** For custom styling and layout.
